And if other person will get it, your money will be stolen. Treat this question as secure, as if tokens in your wallet will cost a billion dollars some time.\n\nTo buy ADM tokens, go to Wallet tab and click Buy Tokens, or open the page https://adamant.im/buy-tokens/ in the web browser. In the form enter your ADAMANT address — you will receive ADM tokens there. If you moved from Messenger App, your ADM address will be filled already. Next, choose crypto you want to spend and its amount. You'll see how much ADM tokens you will receive, including volume bonus: 20–30 ETH: +20%, 30–50 ETH: +30%, 50–90 ETH: +40%, 90+ ETH: +50%. Click Buy ADAMANT tokens. You'll get unique address where you need to send crypto. As soon as your transaction will be confirmed, you'll receive ADM tokens. Transaction can be done **from any wallet or exchange**. It is not necessary to transfer exact amount including transaction fees, the payment will be processed anyway.\n\nAfter you receive ADM tokens, we recommend to keep them as long as possible. All of unsold tokens will be distributed among users' wallets, adding 5% monthly. Additional info is on Adamant.im website and in the Whitepaper.\n\nDo not reply to this message, it is a system account. If you still have any questions, contact account **U15677078342684640219**.";

Keep your secret passphrase secure. Set a password on your device or logout before leaving.\n\nLearn more about security and anonymity at https://adamant.im/staysecured.\n\nAll the transactions within the blockchain do need to have their minimal fees. This is necessary to support the network infrastructure. To start messengning now, **get free tokens** — go to Wallet tab and click Free ADM tokens. Then click Start new chat on Chats tab and put your interlocutor's address. To copy your address, click on Account on Wallet tab.\n\nDo not reply to this message, it is a system account.
